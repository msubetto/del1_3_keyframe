        <h3>Roomba cleans routinely, so you don't have to!</h3>
          <p>Roomba cleans with a touch of a button. Press a button and it moves on its own cleaning up the messes. Once it senses that it hits a wall or an obstacle, Roomba turns and goes around it. Roomba cleans until the job is done, once its done cleaning it returns back to its home plate.</p>
